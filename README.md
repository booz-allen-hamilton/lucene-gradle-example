# lucene-gradle-example

A simple, Gradle-based app that demonstrates how to integrate Apache Lucene
into a Java project.

This is in case you wish to use Lucene directly instead of Apache Solr
or Elasticsearch.

## Contents

In addition to the `build.gradle` file, there is a single Java class.
This class comes from lucenetutorial.com, which looks to be a
nice gentle introduction on how to use Lucene.
